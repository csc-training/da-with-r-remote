# Data manipulation - independent exercises

In this section we have some extra exercises for the first day of the R course, for those who are interested to test their R skills a little more. Here we explore real-life COVID-19 data as an example of using data from open data application programming interfaces (APIs). 

**Exclaimer:** The exercises are only examples and should not be taken as true representations of the COVID-19 situation in Finland.

The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) open data interface is used here to observe COVID-19 infections and tests in Finland. More information on the interface can be found on the [THL website](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/statistics/statistical-databases/open-data/confirmed-corona-cases-in-finland-covid-19-).

**Begin by installing** the package `rjstat` and loading the necessary libraries in RStudio. Remember to start a new R script (these should be the first commands on the script).

```r
install.packages("rjstat")

library(rjstat)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### **1. Getting the data**


You can quickly run through the following lines if you are not interested in the API.
Make sure to **copy and run each R code chunk** in RStudio to ensure that you get the data in the correct format.

**1.1** Copy the address of the API from where we will retrieve the data in [json format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html):

```r
url <- "https://sampo.thl.fi/pivot/prod/en/epirapo/covid19case/fact_epirapo_covid19case.json?"
```

**1.2** Specify dimensions of the API that we would like to use (there are also other dimensions available). Here we have the amount of infections (`measure.infections`), the date (`time.day`) and the hospital district (`region.shp`).

```r
measure.infections <- "measure-444833"
time.day <- "dateweek2020010120201231-443702L"
region.shp <- "hcdmunicipality2020-445222"
```

**1.3** Write a character string to obtain the daily coronavirus infections by hospital district:

```r
url.call <- paste0(url, "column=", measure.infections, "&row=", time.day, "&row=", region.shp)
```

**1.4** Read in the data using `fromJSONstat()` and check the structure of the data frame. You should see that the data are given as as a list ("`List of 1`").

```r
data <- fromJSONstat(readLines(url.call, encoding = "UTF-8"))
str(data)
```

**1.5** Create a data frame from the original data (this is much more likely to be useful for further analyses):

```r
data <- data$`COVID-19 cases in the infectious diseases registry`
```

Convert the `value` column to numeric:

```r
data$value <- as.numeric(data$value)
```

Now we are ready for some exercises!

#### **2. Exercises**


**2.1** Look at the first lines of the data and check the structure of the object.

```r
# Write the answer in your R script

head(data)
str(data)

# can also use pipe: e.g. data %>% head()
```

Next, calculate the cases by hospital district and sum the daily numbers of infections.

```r
data_regionsums <- data %>%
  group_by(hcdmunicipality2020) %>%
  summarise(observations = sum(value))

summary(data_regionsums)
```

**2.2** Look at the data frame below (`data_regionsums`). Why does every observation have the value `NA`? Fix the code!

```r
# Fix the code below

# data_regionsums <- data %>%
#  group_by(hcdmunicipality2020) %>%
#  summarise(observations = sum(value))

# need to remove NAs:

data_regionsums <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%
  group_by(hcdmunicipality2020) %>%
  summarise(observations = sum(value))

# or (although prefer the above because removes NAs before any further operations):

data_regionsums <- data %>%
  group_by(hcdmunicipality2020) %>%
  summarise(observations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE))  
```

**2.3** Delete the row that has the overall daily sum of observations ("All areas").
```r
# Write the answer in your R script

data_regionsums <- data_regionsums %>%
  filter(hcdmunicipality2020 != "All areas")
```

**2.4** Use `data_regionsums` to check which hospital districts have had the most COVID-19 infections and print the top 5.

```r
# Write the answer in your R script

data_regionsums %>%
  arrange(desc(observations)) %>%
  head(5)
```

#### **3. Saving and exporting your script**

You won't need to save the data, but it's a good idea to save the R script as we will run through the answers tomorrow. Can you remember how to save and export it? You can find some instructions in the [Starting with data exercise sheet](https://e-learn.csc.fi/mod/resource/view.php?id=574) (steps 7.3 and 7.4).
