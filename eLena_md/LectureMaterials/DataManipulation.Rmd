- Import a CSV file and export a data frame using the `read_csv` and `write_csv` commands from the `readr` package 

#### 1. Data manipulation using `dplyr` and `tidyr`

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read, especially for complicated operations. Enter `dplyr`. `dplyr` is a package for making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with `tidyr` which enables you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more stuff. The functions we’ve been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. The RStudio session we are running already has the `tidyverse` package installed. This is an “umbrella-package” that installs several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such as `tidyr`,  `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tibble`, etc.

The `tidyverse` package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.
2. Using R expressions in a non-standard way, which can be confusing for new learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware of.

We have seen in our previous lesson that when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced (=converted) into the `factor` data type. We had to set `stringsAsFactors` to **`FALSE`** to avoid this hidden argument to convert our data type.

This time we will use the `tidyverse` package to read the data and avoid having to set `stringsAsFactors` to **`FALSE`**.

**Note:**  To install `tidyverse`, one could type `install.packages("tidyverse")` straight into the console. In fact, it would be better to write this in the console than in our script for any package, as there’s no need to re-install packages every time we run the script.

To load the package type:

```r
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
```

#### 2. What are `dplyr` and `tidyr`?

The package `dplyr` provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks, and is built to work directly with data frames. 

**Note:** While we won't be covering this topic further here, an additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package `tidyr` addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups - like plots or aquaria. Moving back and forth between these formats is nontrivial, and `tidyr` gives you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.

To learn more about `dplyr` and `tidyr` after the workshop, you may want to check out this [handy data transformation with `dplyr` cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and this [one about `tidyr`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

We’ll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse package `readr`, instead of `read.csv()`.

```r
surveys <- read_csv("/data/portal_data_joined.csv")

#> Parsed with column specification:
#> cols(
#>   record_id = col_double(),
#>   month = col_double(),
#>   day = col_double(),
#>   year = col_double(),
#>   plot_id = col_double(),
#>   species_id = col_character(),
#>   sex = col_character(),
#>   hindfoot_length = col_double(),
#>   weight = col_double(),
#>   genus = col_character(),
#>   species = col_character(),
#>   taxa = col_character(),
#>   plot_type = col_character()
#> )
```

```r
## inspect the data
str(surveys)
```

```r
## preview the data
View(surveys)
```

The data are now in a format referred to as a “tibble”. Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced previously. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.

We’re going to learn some of the most common `dplyr` functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

#### 3. Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```r
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a “-” in front of the variable to exclude it.

```r
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all variables in `surveys` except `record_id` and `species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```r
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

#### 4. Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that as input to the next function, like this:

```r
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```r
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), 
                            species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a more recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr` package, installed automatically with `dplyr`. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M` if you have a PC or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `M` if you have a Mac.

```r
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first through `filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then through `select()` to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don’t need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then”. For instance, in the above example, we take the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter` for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select` the columns `species_id`, `sex` and `weight`. The `dplyr` functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:

```r
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame (`surveys_sml`) is the leftmost part of this expression.

**Challenge**

Go through the exercises in **Data Manipulation Exercise Block 1** (~5 mins).

#### 5. The `mutate` function

Frequently you’ll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we’ll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_kg2 = weight_kg * 2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-`dplyr` functions, too, as long as the `dplyr` or `magrittr` package is loaded).

```r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`. The `!` symbol negates the result, so we’re asking for every row where weight *is not* an `NA`.

**Challenge**

Go through Data Manipulation **Exercise Block 2** (~5-10 mins).

#### 6. Split-apply-combine and `summarize`

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. `dplyr` makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

`group_by()` is often used together with the `summarize()` function, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```
As part of the output, we see the line: "`summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)". This is not an error, but a recently introduced feature in the `dplyr` package. We won't go into it in detail, but for information: `dplyr` now comes with extra features for tweaking the output of split-apply-combine steps like the one above. This could be useful e.g. when transforming your data.

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn’t run off the screen anymore. It’s one of the advantages of the tibble format.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
  
# Here, we see that the output is grouped by "sex", even if we specify two columns in group_by:
# `summarise()` regrouping output by 'sex' (override with `.groups` argument)

```

When grouping both by `sex` and `species_id`, the last few rows are for animals that escaped before their sex and body weights could be determined. We can use `tail()` to look at the last six rows in the data:

```r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  tail()
```

You may notice that the last column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which refers to “Not a Number”). To avoid this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we attempt to calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing values are removed first, we can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

```r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn’t run off the screen anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to display:

```r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

**Challenge**

There are a few other things we can try out using the split-apply-combine paradigm. Let's try these out by going through the exercises in **Data Manipulation Exercise Block 3** (10-15 mins).

#### 7. Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, `dplyr` provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```r
surveys %>%
    count(sex) 
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we’ve already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is equivalent to:

```r
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:

```r
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE) 
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). If we wanted to count a *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```r
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) 
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:

```r
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75 observations of the *albigula* species that are not specified for its sex (i.e. `NA`).

**Challenge**

Let's have a look at the counting exercises in **Data Manipulation Exercise Block 4** (~10 mins).

#### 8. Reshaping with `gather` and `spread`

When we previously discussed recommended practices for data organisation, we were actually talking about how to structure our data according to the four rules defining a tidy dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table (rather than multiple tables)

In `surveys` , the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables associated with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex of each animal associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we wanted to compare the different mean weight of each species between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We’d need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values of the species in `genus` would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is straightforward to explore the relationship between the weight of different species within, and between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest: average species weight per plot instead of recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions, `spread()` and `gather()`.

#### 8a. Spreading

`spread()` takes three principal arguments:

1. The data

2. The *key* column variable whose values will become new column names.  

3. The *value* column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.

What `spread()` does is to reshape a data set from *long format* to *wide format*:

![](Images/spread_data_R.png?raw=true)

Further arguments include `fill` which, if set, fills in missing values with the value provided.

Let’s use `spread()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight of each species in each plot over the entire survey period. First we use `filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` to filter our observations and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the `mean_weight`. We use the pipe as before too.

```r
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(genus, plot_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

str(surveys_gw)
```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread across multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. Using `spread()` to key on `genus` with values from `mean_weight`, this becomes 24 observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot. We again use pipes:

```r
surveys_spread <- surveys_gw %>%
  spread(key = genus, value = mean_weight)

str(surveys_spread)
```

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of species in different plots, although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

```r
surveys_gw %>%
  spread(genus, mean_weight, fill = 0) %>%
  head()
```

#### 8b. Gathering

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the form of `surveys_spread` (i.e. in wide format), where the genus names are column names, but we wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and the other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.

`gather()` takes four principal arguments:

1. The data
2. The *key* column variable we wish to create from column names.
3. The *values* column variable we wish to create and fill with values associated with the key.
4. The names of the columns we use to fill the key variable (or to drop).

What `gather()` does is to reshape a data set from *wide* to *long* format:

![](Images/gather_data_R.png?raw=true)

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_spread` we would create a key called `genus` and value called `mean_weight`, and use all columns except `plot_id` for the key variable. Here we drop the `plot_id` column with a minus sign.

```r
surveys_gather <- surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = genus, value = mean_weight, -plot_id)

str(surveys_gather)
```

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the re-gathered format. Spreading and then gathering can be a useful way to balance out a dataset so every replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it’s easier to specify what to gather than what to leave alone. Moreover, if the columns are in a row, we don’t even need to list them all out - just use the `:` operator!

```r
surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = genus, value = mean_weight, 
                      Baiomys:Spermophilus) %>%
  head()
```

**Challenge**

Have a look at **Data Manipulation Exercise Block 5** (~15 mins).

#### 9. `write_csv` for data exporting

We previously used the `write.csv` function call to export our data from R. The package `readr` (part of the `tidyverse`) comes with another function for exporting CSV files: `write_csv`.  You might remember that when using `write.csv`, it was necessary to add an extra argument to remove row numbers from the resulting CSV file (`row.names = FALSE`). The `write_csv` function never writes row names, which can simplify things when saving your data for future use.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare a cleaned up version of the data set that doesn’t include any missing data.

Let’s start by removing observations of animals for which `weight` and `hindfoot_length` are missing, or the `sex` has not been determined:

```r
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))              # remove missing sex
```

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have changed through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare species (i.e., that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do this in two steps: first, we are going to create a data set that counts how often each species has been observed, and filter out the rare species. Second, we will extract only the observations for these more common species:

```r
## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>% 
    filter(n >= 50)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same data set, check that `surveys_complete` has 30463 rows and 13 columns by typing `dim(surveys_complete)`.

Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our `data_output` folder.

```r
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data_output/surveys_complete.csv")
```

To make sure we're all on the same page, these steps are replicated in **Data Manipulation Exercise Block 6**. Take some time (~5-10 mins) to run through them.
