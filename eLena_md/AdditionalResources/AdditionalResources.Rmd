# Additional resources for getting further with R

#### 1. Downloading R and RStudio on your own computer

R and RStudio are free to download and use. Go to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Note that you have to download both R and RStudio. If you are using a university or research institute computer, your institution's software distribution system probably has R and RStudio available.

Next, install some packages. A good start would be `tidyverse` that we used on the course, which is actually a collection of many useful packages. The easiest way is to use the the Packages tab -> Install in the lower right panel of RStudio. Most packages come from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), R's central software repository.

#### 2. Websites and books

There are lots of great books, websites and online tutorials for learning more about R. Some examples:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (free e-book) A great tidyverse-based resource.

- [Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/getting-started-with-r-9780198787846?cc=fi&lang=en&) (book) 

- [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) (website) Check for example the section on graphs (lots of information on finetuning your ggplot2 plots).

- [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/) (website) A huge collection of R resources.

- [Modern Statistics with R](https://modernstatisticswithr.com/) (website and book) A great, up-to-date introduction to R and data wrangling that goes deep and wide into statistical analyses with R.

- [Applied Statistics with R](https://book.stat420.org/) (free e-book)

- [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/)  (free e-book)

- [An Introduction to R](https://intro2r.com/) (free e-book) Covers also the basics of R Markdown and version  control.

- [Riffomonas Code Club](https://riffomonas.org/code_club/) Youtube channel and R scripts. R basics and more advanced tricks especially for microbial ecologists.

- [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/): an R package for interactive self-learning within R

- [Deep R Programming](https://deepr.gagolewski.com/index.html) (website and pdf) A more programming-oriented introduction to R.

#### 3. R cheat sheets

Cheat sheets are handy collections of commands and options on a specific package or a topic. Here are some examples:

- [`ggplot2` for plotting ](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)  
- [data manipulation with `dplyr`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/data-transformation.pdf)  
- [data tidying with `tidyr`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/tidyr.pdf)  

#### 4. Using R on CSC's supercomputers

If get to the point that your R scripts are too computationally heavy to run on your own computer, it might be time to look for extra resources. R is available on CSC's supercomputer Puhti. Like many CSC's services, Puhti is free to use if you are affiliated with a Finnish higher education institution or a state research institute. An introduction to using R in CSC's services is available as [slides here](https://a3s.fi/heli-slides/User_zoom_Rintro_23112022.pdf) and [as a talk here](https://video.csc.fi/media/t/0_t0pp68xr?pk_vid=86530b39c9d332d516753361092bbf0f), and further instructions on using the Puhti R environment can be found [here](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/).
