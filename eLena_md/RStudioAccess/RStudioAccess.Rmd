# Accessing the RStudio teaching environment on notebooks.csc.fi

To launch your own instance of R:

1. Go to [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi/#/) and log in using the Haka or Virtu authentication service or with your CSC account. If you do not have access to any of these, please contact the course instructors.
2. In the top right corner, click "Join workspace" and enter the code provided by the instructors.
3. You should see a workspace with an RStudio environment called "Data Analysis with R, April-May 2023)". Later you can find it under "My workspaces".
4. Click on the "Start session" button on the right to start RStudio.

Note: each RStudio session in this workspace lasts for 12 hours, after which it is automatically erased. We will cover ways to save your code and data for later work during this workshop!
