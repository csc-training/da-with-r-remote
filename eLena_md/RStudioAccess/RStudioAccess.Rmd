# Accessing the RStudio teaching environment on notebooks.csc.fi

To launch your own instance of R:

1. Go to [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi/#/) and log in using the Haka authentication service.
2. In the top right corner, click "Join workspace" and enter the code provided by the instructors.
3. You should see a workspace with an RStudio environment called "RStudio Server (Data Analysis with R, November 2022)". Later you can find it under "My workspaces".
4. Click on the "Start session" button on the right to start RStudio.

Note: each RStudio session in this workspace lasts for 12 hours, after which it is automatically erased. We will cover ways to save your code and data for later work during this workshop!
