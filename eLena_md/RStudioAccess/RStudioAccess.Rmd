# Accessing the RStudio teaching environment on notebooks.csc.fi

To launch your own instance of R:

1. Go to [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi/#/) and log in using the Haka authentication service.
2. Find "RStudio environment for DAKI and teaching activities" in the dashboard and click on "Launch new". Note: there is also an environment called "RStudio Server", but we won't use that during the course.
3. Wait for the virtual machine to start and click on "Open in browser" once the link appears.
4. Your browser will open a new window with login and password details. Press "Click to copy password & proceed".
5. This will open up the RStudio login screen. Enter **rstudio** as the username and paste your password to open up a new RStudio session. The password can be pasted using `Ctrl + V` (Windows) or `âŒ˜ + V` (macOS).

Note: each RStudio session on [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi/#/) lasts for 10 hours, after which it is automatically erased. We will cover ways to save your code and data for later work during this workshop!
