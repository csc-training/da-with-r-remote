#### **Block 1: downloading and importing data**

This exercise block repeats the lecture contents - at this point it's important that we're all on the
same page! We will need these data as we move on.

**1.1** Import some example data (`/data/portal_data_joined.csv`) into an object called `surveys`. When importing the data, use the argument `stringsAsFactors = TRUE`. You can use `head()` to check that everything got imported correctly.

**1.2** We just imported data from outside our current working directory. Let's also try something inside the working directory - create a new folder called `testfolder` (Files pane on the bottom right --> New folder).

#### **Block 2: inspecting data frames**

**2.1** Inspect the `surveys` data set using the following functions. We don't need to memorize them now, but eventually this can be useful when you are working with your own data.

- Size:
  - `dim()` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of the object)
  - `nrow()` - number of rows
  - `ncol()` - number of columns
- Content:
  - `head()` - first 6 rows
  - `tail()` - last 6 rows
- Names:
  - `names()` - column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
  - `rownames()` - row names
- Summary:
  - `str()` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column
  - `summary()` - summary statistics for each column

**2.2** Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

- What is the class of the object `surveys`?
- How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
- How many different species IDs have been recorded during these surveys?

#### **Block 3: indexing and subsetting data frames**

**3.1** Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset.

**3.2** Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
   
   - Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
   - Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations.
   - Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
   - Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

**3.3** Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

**3.4** A trickier example: combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset. Don't worry if you can't get this one right!

#### **Block 4: factors**

**4.1** First assign the gender data from `surveys` to a new object. You probably also remember there are some measurements where the gender information is either missing or undetermined, let's call those "undetermined".

```r
sex <- surveys$sex
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
```

**4.2** Rename “F” and “M” to “female” and “male”, respectively.

**4.3** Can you reorder the data so that the levels are ordered like this: `undetermined`, `male`, `female`? After this, use `plot()` to check how the data now look.

#### **Block 5: more on data frames**


**5.1** We have seen how data frames are created when using `read.csv()`, but they can also be created by hand with the `data.frame()` function. There are a few mistakes in this hand-crafted `data.frame`. Can you spot and fix them? Don’t hesitate to experiment!

```r
animal_data <- data.frame(
          animal = c(dog, cat, sea cucumber, sea urchin),
          feel = c("furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
          weight = c(45, 8 1.1, 0.8)
          )
```

**5.2** Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example? Check your guesses using `str(country_climate)`:

- Are they what you expected? Why? Why not?
- What would have been different if we had added `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` when creating the data frame?
- What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the accurate data type?

```r
country_climate <- data.frame(
       country = c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
       climate = c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
       temperature = c(10, 30, 18, "15"),
       northern_hemisphere = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),
       has_kangaroo = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1)
       )
```

#### **Block 6: arguments for CSV importing**

**6.1** Import a new data set on car speeds (`/data/car-speeds.csv`) and assign it to an object called `carSpeeds`.

```r
carSpeeds <- read.csv("/data/car-speeds.csv")
```

**6.2** Have a look at the structure of `carSpeeds` using `str()`. Then try reimporting the data with the header argument set to false. How does the new data set differ from the previous one? 

**6.3** The car colour labels contain accidental whitespaces. To fix this, try importing the data using the `strip.white` argument. NOTE - this argument must be accompanied by the `sep` argument, by which we indicate the type of delimiter in the file (the comma for most .csv files). In other words, we need to add `sep = ','` to the import command. You can use `unique()` to check if it worked!

#### **Block 7: exporting data and saving scripts**

The steps here are identical to what we just covered, but it's good to run through them by yourself!

**7.1** Create a new folder for output files, called `data_output`.

**7.2** Export the car speeds data. The write.csv() function requires a minimum of two arguments, the data to be saved and the name of the output file.

```r
write.csv(carSpeeds, file = "data_output/car-speeds-cleaned.csv")
```

**7.3** Save your script (File --> Save as...).

**7.4** Export your data from RStudio Server.

```
- Go to the "Files" pane (on the right, next to "Plots")

- Tick the empty boxes next to the files / folders you would like to export

- Click on "More" (look for a cogwheel symbol)

- Click on "Export". After this, specify a suitable name for the .zip file. The file will be saved into your default downloads folder. 
```
