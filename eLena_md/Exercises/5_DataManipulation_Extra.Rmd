# Data manipulation - independent exercises

In this section we have some extra exercises for the first day of the R course, for those who are interested to test their R skills a little more. Here we explore data from [Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF)](https://laji.fi/en/about/2986) as an example of using data from open data application programming interfaces (APIs).

We will use an R package `finbif` that is an R interface to the FinBIF API. This means we can use the R package to download data from FinBIF directly to R and then continue working with it. You can find more information on the package here: <https://luomus.github.io/finbif/>

### **1. Getting the data**

**IMPORTANT:** There are two options for how to get the data. Choose one of them:

**Option 1:** On your own computer that has R and RStudio installed (see [here](https://e-learn.csc.fi/mod/url/view.php?id=2191) for instructions).

**Option 2:** On Notebooks as the rest of the course exercises.

#### **Option 1 using your own computer: start here**

Begin by installing the package `finbif` and loading the necessary libraries in RStudio. Remember to start a new R script (these should be the first commands on the script).

``` r
# install the packages `finbif` (and `tidyverse` if not already installed)
install.packages("finbif")
install.packages("tidyverse")

# load the packages ´finbif´ and ´tidyverse´
library(finbif)
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, we have to get an access token to access the FinBIF data. Replace your\@email.com with your email address. You will then receive the token by email.

``` r
finbif_request_token("your@email.com")
```

Copy the token and active it in R (technically speaking we are setting an environmental variable called FINBIF_ACCESS_TOKEN and giving the token as the value). Replace the long string in quotation marks with the token you received by email.

``` r
Sys.setenv(FINBIF_ACCESS_TOKEN = "xtmSOIxjPwq0pOMB1WvcZgFLU9QBklauOlonWl8K5oaLIx8RniJLrvcJU4v9H7Et")

# Note: this is not a real token and should be replaced with your own one
```

Now we are ready to retrieve data. Let's retrieve the latest 5000 observations of the barn swallow (*Hirundo rustica*, haarapääsky) from FinBIF with the R package `finbif`.

Add the following command to your R script and run it as it is. To see what the options in the command `finbif_occurrence` mean and what other options are available to control data retrieval, you can check the [manual the `finbif` package on CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/finbif/finbif.pdf) (the central repository for R packages).

``` r
swallows_data <- finbif_occurrence("Hirundo rustica", n=5000, select = c("default_vars", "bio_province"))
```

#### **Option 2 using Notebooks: start here**

Launch RStudio in Notebooks. Load the tidyverse package:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Import an R data object (made using the above in option 1 - please have a look at them!) into R:

``` r
swallows_data <- readRDS("/home/rstudio/shared/swallows_data.rds")
```

#### **Both options: continue from here!**

### **2. Data formatting**

**2.1** Before getting started on the exercises for data manipulation, let's make a copy of the data to keep original data intact, Then, we will simplify the formatting of dates and remove double entries for regions (`bio_province`). We will also remove observations with dates in winter because we don't expect swallows to occur then. Copy-paste these lines to your R script and run them as they are.

``` r
# making a copy of the data
swallows <- swallows_data

# setting format of the column ´date_time´ to year-month-day
swallows$date_time = as.Date(format(swallows$date_time, "%Y-%m-%d"))

# removing observations in 2023 and before March 2022
swallows <- swallows %>% filter(date_time < "2023-01-01" & date_time > "2022-03-01")

# removing double entries in the column ´bio_province´ by replacing text with the function gsub
swallows$bio_province <- gsub(",.*", "", swallows$bio_province)
```

Now we are ready for some exercises!

### **3. Exercises**

**3.1** Look at the first lines of the data and check the structure of the object.

``` r
# Write the answer in your R script.
```

**3.2** The column `bio_province` shows the region of the observation. Let's calculate the number of swallows observations (rows in the data) by region.

``` r
# Write the answer in your R script.
```

Check the resulting data frame `by_region`. At the bottom there is a region called NA. If you look at the column `bio_province` in `swallows` carefully or run `tail(swallows)`, you will notice that some observations are missing the information on region.

**3.3** Let's fix the problem by modifying the code from the previous step. Remove observations that have NA in the column `bio_province`.

``` r
# Write the answer in your R script.
```

**3.4** Use `by_region` to check which region had the most observations of barn swallows and print the top 5.

``` r
# Write the answer in your R script.
```

### **4. Saving and exporting your script**

You won't need to save the data, but it's a good idea to save the R script as we will run through the answers tomorrow. Can you remember how to save and export it? You can find some instructions in the **Starting with Data exercise sheet** (steps 7.3 and 7.4).
