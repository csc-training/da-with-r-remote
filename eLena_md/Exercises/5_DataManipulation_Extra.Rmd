# Data manipulation - independent exercises

In this section we have some extra exercises for the first day of the R course, for those who are interested to test their R skills a little more. Here we explore real-life COVID-19 data as an example of using data from open data application programming interfaces (APIs). 

**Exclaimer:** The exercises are only examples and should not be taken as true representations of the COVID-19 situation in Finland.

The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) open data interface is used here to observe COVID-19 infections and tests in Finland. More information on the interface can be found on the [THL website](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/statistics/statistical-databases/open-data/confirmed-corona-cases-in-finland-covid-19-).

**Begin by installing** the package `rjstat` (which is not included in the default package selection of our R environment) and loading the necessary libraries in RStudio. Remember to start a new R script (these should be the first commands on the script).

```r
install.packages("rjstat")

library(rjstat)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### **1. Getting the data**

You can quickly run through the following lines if you are not interested in the API.
Make sure to **copy and run each R code chunk** in RStudio to ensure that you get the data in the correct format.

**1.1** Copy the address of the API from where we will retrieve the data in [json format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html):

```r
url.call <- "https://sampo.thl.fi/pivot/prod/en/epirapo/covid19case/fact_epirapo_covid19case.json?row=hcdmunicipality2020-445222&column=dateweek20200101-509030&filter=measure-444833"

# Note: This step was updated on 14.01.2021 to reflect changes made to the THL API.
```

**1.2** Read in the data using `fromJSONstat()` and check the structure of the data frame. You should see that the data are given as as a list ("`List of 1`").

```r
data <- fromJSONstat(readLines(url.call, encoding = "UTF-8"))
str(data)
```

**1.3** Create a data frame from the original data (this is much more likely to be useful for further analyses):

```r
data <- data$`COVID-19 cases in the infectious diseases registry`
```

**1.4** Convert the `value` column to numeric:

```r
data$value <- as.numeric(data$value)
```

**1.5** Remove a row in the column `dateweek20200101` with a summary of infection rates for all times.

```r
data <- data %>%
  filter(dateweek20200101 != "All times")
```

Now we are ready for some exercises!

#### **2. Exercises**


**2.1** Look at the first lines of the data and check the structure of the object.

```r
# Write the answer in your R script

```

Next, calculate the cases by hospital district and sum the weekly numbers of infections.

```r
data_regionsums <- data %>%
  group_by(hcdmunicipality2020) %>%
  summarise(observations = sum(value))

summary(data_regionsums)
```

**2.2** Look at the data frame below (`data_regionsums`). Why does every observation have the value `NA`? Fix the code!

```r
# Fix the code below

data_regionsums <- data %>%
  group_by(hcdmunicipality2020) %>%
  summarise(observations = sum(value))
```

**2.3** Delete the row that has the overall weekly sum of observations ("All areas").
```r
# Write the answer in your R script

```

**2.4** Use `data_regionsums` to check which hospital districts have had the most COVID-19 infections and print the top 5.

```r
# Write the answer in your R script

```

#### **3. Saving and exporting your script**

You won't need to save the data, but it's a good idea to save the R script as we will run through the answers tomorrow. Can you remember how to save and export it? You can find some instructions in the **Starting with Data exercise sheet** (steps 7.3 and 7.4).
